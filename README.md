Integrated a machine learning model for price prognosis into the project using LSTM networks:
- Added a new module 'price_prediction.py' containing the predictive model logic.
- Incorporated historical data for training and testing the prediction model.
- Created visualizations using Matplotlib to display model predictions and actual prices over time.
- Updated README with instructions on how to use the price prediction feature.
These changes enhance the project's functionality by introducing predictive analytics for price trends.s
